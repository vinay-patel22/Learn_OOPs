/* 
1) Class in Java:
   - A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. It defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) for objects.
   - A class can have:
     - Fields (variables)
     - Methods (functions)
     - Constructors (for initializing objects)
     - Blocks (static and instance blocks)
     - Nested classes and interfaces

2) Object in Java:
   - An object is an instance of a class. 
   - It has three main characteristics:
     - **State**: Represented by fields/variables.
     - **Behavior**: Represented by methods/functions.
     - **Identity**: The reference that uniquely identifies the object.

3) The 'this' Keyword:
   - Refers to the current object or instance of the class.
   - It is used:
     1) To access instance variables when they are shadowed by constructor or method parameters.
     2) To pass the current object as a parameter to another method or constructor.
