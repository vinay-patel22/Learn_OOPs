/*
    -> An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class, containing static constants and abstract methods.
    -> Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and provide support for multiple inheritance.
    -> They are also used to achieve loose coupling between classes by defining expected behavior without specifying the implementation.

    Key Characteristics:
    - An interface can only have abstract methods (Java 8+ also allows default and static methods).
    - All variables declared in an interface are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`.
    - Interfaces cannot contain concrete (non-abstract) method implementations (except for `default` and `static` methods in Java 8+).
*/

/*
    Why use Java interfaces?

    1) Achieve abstraction by defining a contract of methods that implementing classes must fulfill.
    2) Enable multiple inheritance by allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces.
    3) Promote loose coupling, where the implementation details of a class are hidden behind an interface.

    Relationship between classes and interfaces:

            extends
    class ------------> class

            implements
    class ------------> interface

                extends
    interface ------------> interface

/*
 * Explanation of Multiple Inheritance via Interfaces:
 * 
 * - Java does not support multiple inheritance with classes due to ambiguity
 * issues (e.g., if two superclasses have methods with the same name).
 * - However, it does allow multiple inheritance via interfaces, as thereâ€™s no
 * ambiguity in implementation.
 * - Each class implementing the interface provides its own method definitions,
 * so no conflicting implementation occurs.
