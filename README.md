## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects." It is widely used in Java and many other programming languages. OOP provides a way to model real-world entities and their interactions in software development.

## Java OOP Concepts

In Java, several key OOP concepts are essential to understand:

1. **Classes and Objects**: Everything in Java is an object, and objects are created from classes.

2. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reuse.

3. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism enables an object to take on many forms, allowing for method overloading and overriding.

4. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation restricts access to some of an object's components, protecting the integrity of the data.

5. **Abstraction**: Abstraction focuses on the essential features of an object while hiding the non-essential details.

6. **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: These are used to create contracts for classes to implement.

7. **Composition**: Composition is a design technique where a class is composed of one or more objects of other classes.

## Code Examples

You'll find code examples in this repository to illustrate various OOP concepts in Java. Explore these examples to see how OOP principles are applied in practice.

## Conceptual Questions

To reinforce your understanding of OOP in Java, we've included a set of conceptual questions in this repository. These questions cover a range of topics, from basic concepts to more advanced OOP principles.
